Installation Guide
This mod contains two sets of files:

Mystical Agriculture Crop Files (via Mystical Customization)

Mystical Customization Crop Files
These define the custom growable herbs and are required for the mod to function.

To install:

config/mysticalcustomization/crops/

- Copy the entire contents of the crops/ folder from this repository into that directory.

- Launch the game â€” your herbal crops will now appear in Mystical Agriculture!

Optional: KubeJS Item Color Script
This script gives all herb-related items unique colors and formatting to make identification easier in-game. Inspired by the original Herbal Overhaul mod.

To install:

- Make sure KubeJS is installed.

- Navigate to your Minecraft script directory:
kubejs/client_scripts/

- Copy herbal_expansion_modifications.js into that folder.

- Restart the game to apply the name changes.
